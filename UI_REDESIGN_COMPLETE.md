### The Problem
1. **Public Visibility** - All payment amounts visible on Solana Explorer
2. **Competitive Disadvantage** - Competitors can analyze payroll
3. **Privacy Violations** - Employee data exposed without consent
4. **Compliance Challenges** - Difficult to balance transparency and privacy

### Our Solution
1. **Off-Chain Encryption** - NaCl Box encryption
2. **On-Chain Commitments** - SHA256 hashes only
3. **Selective Disclosure** - Compliance-ready audit trails

### How It Works
1. Create Payment Batch

3. Approve & Execute
4. Recipients Decrypt
