# Pin constant_time_eq to version compatible with Rust 1.75.0 (Solana's Rust version)
# Version 0.4.2 requires edition2024 which Rust 1.75.0 doesn't support
# Solution: Use [patch.crates-io] to patch all constant_time_eq dependencies to 0.2.6
# This works by patching the dependency before resolution
