# Pin dependencies to versions compatible with Rust 1.75.0 (Solana's Rust version)
# constant_time_eq v0.4.2 requires edition2024 which Rust 1.75.0 doesn't support
# indexmap v2.13.0 requires Rust 1.82+ features, but Rust 1.75.0 doesn't support them
# Solution: Use [patch.crates-io] to patch dependencies to compatible versions
